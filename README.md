Fixed-price - Intermediate - Est. Budget: $75 - Posted 13 hours ago 

- put together a simple one page 
'business card' website / landing page. 

- have design and can provide 
- graphic assets(images, icons, logo, fonts etc). 
landing page - responsive 
- landscape layout for desktop computers 
- portrait layout for phones and tablets

- host with Netfirms 
- will likely require assistance with page loaded to host 
with files provided to me at end 
- have multiple URLs that I would like directed to the page; 
will require your assistance in getting that set up properly. 
an icon will need to link to Instagram account. 
intend using Google analytics to review traffic

## See mockups
- desktop, mobile, and tablet. 
- hoping the shadow can apply to text & logo, & bg. 
- I don't intend revising design but expect may need several rounds 
of communication until everything looks correct
- (e.g. font, logo size optimization etc)
